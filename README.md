# Code Reviews with PRs Guide

### TL;DR

This guide guide is for people who'd like to spread good code review practices in their teams.

It aims to be a reference to show to your people, along with some good examples.

It takes elements from both [this post on github blog](https://github.com/blog/1943-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request) and [the thoughtbot guide](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/code-review).


## Intro

This guide is best suited for companies/teams using `github` or `github entreprise` to manage their code and code reviews, but the same principles apply elsewhere. 

It will try to explain the best practices on creating PRs, reviewing them, common ways of doing things, the `do`s and `don't`s, and we will cover the :shipit: squirrel.
