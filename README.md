# Code Reviews with PRs Guide

### TL;DR

This guide guide is for people who'd like to spread good code review practices in their teams.

It aims to be a reference to show to your people, along with some good examples.

It takes elements from both [this post on github blog](https://github.com/blog/1943-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request) and [the thoughtbot guide](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/code-review).

## Intro

This guide is best suited for companies/teams using `github` or `github entreprise` to manage their code and code reviews, but the same principles apply elsewhere. 

It will try to explain the best practices on creating PRs, reviewing them, common ways of doing things, the `do`s and `don't`s, and we will cover the :shipit: squirrel.

## Anatomy of a PR

### What's a PR again ?

`PR` is a `github`-specific concept which means `pull request`. You can [read on the official docs with plenty of screenshots](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/), but essentially, 

> __PR is an UI for merging changes from one branch to another__, that allows discussion, pasting silly gifs, commenting on particular lines, and by doing that, documenting the change and the thinking behind for later (think onboarding a new person, or just refreshing your own memory).
