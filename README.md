# Code Reviews with PRs Guide

### TL;DR

This guide guide is for people who'd like to spread good code review practices in their teams. 

It aims to be a reference to show to your people, along with some good examples.

It takes elements from both [this post on github blog](https://github.com/blog/1943-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request) and [the thoughtbot guide](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/code-review).
